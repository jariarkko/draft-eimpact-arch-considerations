1.  Introduction

   Sustainability is an important consideration in networking.  Both for
   ensuring that networking technology can enable societies to operate
   in a sustainable manner and that the networks themselves are
   sustainable.

   This document discusses protocol and network architecture aspects
   that may have an impact on the sustainability of network technology.

   Where good design and architecture can improve the sustainability of
   networks, we should of course apply them when designing new protocols
   and building networks.

   But what is such good design and architecture?  Are there guidelines
   that can be given?  Intuitively, protocol and network architecture
   may in some cases have an impact on sustainability.  At the very
   least the right design and architecture can make it possible to have
   a positive impact, but of course the architecture alone is not
   enough.  The possibilities offered by the architecture need to be
   employed by implementations and practical deployments.

   To give an example of architectural aspect that potentially has a
   sustainability impact, enabling the collection of information (e.g.,
   energy consumption data) and then using that information to make
   smarter decisions is one.  Other examples include making it possible
   to scale resources or resource selection processes performed in a
   sustainability-aware fashion.  The use of communication primitives
   that maximise utility in a given problem (e.g., using multicast) or
   the use technologies that reduce the number or size of messages
   needed for a given task (e.g., binary encoding instead of textual)
   are some further examples.

   But there are likely also often tradeoffs, such as side-effects of
   architectural choices, e.g., dynamic scaling of a router network
   potentially impacting jitter.

   This document discusses some of these architectural aspects and
   considerations related to them, and tries to give guidance where such
   guidance can be given.

   The scope of the document is advice on Internet and protocol
   architecture, such as what architecture or capabilities new protocol
   designs or features should have, what kind of operational network
   architectures should be deployed, and how all of these can be
   designed to best address sustainability concerns.

   The document is intended to help engineering efforts in the IETF,
   provide guidance for operationals in the operator community, or point
   to research directions in the IRTF.

   This document is not focused on general issues around sustainability,
   except those that pertain to architecture or significant protocol
   features.

2.  Potential Architectural Aspects

2.1.  Measurement

   You have to know what is going on before you can improve.  Some level
   of measurements are necessary for improving sustainability.  This is
   particularly the case when looking at the systems as a whole and in
   post-analysis.

   But it may also be true for some dynamic situations where power-
   saving decisions for instance depend on knowing the relative power
   consumption of different activities, such as when a power-off
   decision involves understanding the cost of shutdown and startup
   procedures and other reconfiguration elsewhere in the network.

2.1.1.  Motivation

   Measurements are a necessary mechanism for both post-analysis and
   potentially some of the dynamic decisions taken by systems.  Without
   measurements, only aggregate power consumption can be measured, but
   for instance no per-device data about real power usage will be
   available, and as such, there's limited basis for deciding on
   improvements.

2.1.2.  Analysis

   (TBD add something about integrating lifecycle, datasheet etc.
   information and how they are shared)

2.1.3.  Recommendation

2.2.  Dynamic Scaling

   The ability to adjust resources to need, and possibly turn some of
   them off during periods of low usage.  Examples include the set of
   servers needed for a service, how many duplicate links are needed to
   carry high-volume traffic, whether one needs all base stations with
   overlapping coverage areas to be on, etc.

2.2.1.  Motivation

   Outside implementation improvements, dynamic scaling is perhaps the
   method with most promise for reducing power consumption related
   environmental impacts.  Dynamic scaling would not have an impact in
   situations where there's only a single router, base station, or
   server serving a particular route, area, or function.  However, most
   large systems have significant amount of redundancy and spare
   capacity.  Where such capacity can be turned on or off to match the
   actual need at a given time, significant power consumption reductions
   can be achieved.

2.2.2.  Analysis

   Dynamic scaling could be seen as either an alternative or
   complementary to load stabilization, e.g., via “peak shaving”.
   Perhaps the most realistic angle is that both are likely needed.

   The most rudimentary approach to dynamic scaling is just turning some
   resources off.  However, often this is not sufficient and a more
   graceful/engineered approach potentially yields better results.

   A network architects need to understand the impacts of scaling
   changes on users and traffic.  These may include fate of ongoing
   sessions, latency/jitter, packets in flight, or running processes,
   attempts to contact resources that are no longer present, and the
   time it takes for the network to converge to its new state.

   Dynamic scaling requires an understanding of load levels for the
   network, so information collection is required.  It also requires
   understanding the power, time and other costs of making changes.
   (See draft-pignataro for discussion of tradeoffs and multi-objective
   optimization.)

   Some of the strategies that are useful in implementing a well working
   dynamic scaling include:

   *  Ability to enter “no new work” mode for equipment, to enable some
      resources to be eventually released/turned off.

   *  Ability to move ongoing tasks off to other equipment, to prevent
      disruption of already started tasks.

   *  Ability to schedule changes rather than making them abruptly, with
      associated signaling exchanges and possible transient routing and
      other failures.  See for instance the TVR WG work in the IETF.

   *  Efficient propagation of changes of new routes, new set of
      servers, etc. as to reduce the amount of time where state across
      the network is not synchronized.  The needs for the propagation
      solution needs to be driven by dynamic scaling and sustainability
      as well as other aspects, such as recovery from failures.

   *  Never expect a fixed set of resources, plan for dynamic set of
      resources, and build mechanisms to deal with dynamic changes.

   *  Dynamic scaling requires automation in most cases.  See draft-
      pignataro for a discussion of automation.

2.2.3.  Recommendation

   The guidelines above need to be considered specifically for each
   protocol and system design.

2.3.  Transport

   Transport protocols are the flexible tools that make it possible for
   communication flows between parties to adjust themselves to the
   dynamic conditions that exist in the network at any given time:
   available bandwidth, delays, congestion, the ability of a peer to
   send or receive traffic, and so on.  Depending on the conditions, an
   individual flow may carry traffic at widely different rates, may
   pause for some time, etc.  Various higher-level transport solutions
   may also cache or pre-fetch information.

   This behavior will have an effect on sustainability as well, e.g., in
   what periods the endpoint and network systems are active or when they
   could be in reduced activity or sleep states.

2.3.1.  Motivation

   Transport behaviour would have a possibility of impacting how much
   downtime or sleep can be had in the communication system, either on
   the end systems or routers or other equipment in between.  The
   savings can be significant, at least in wireless systems.

2.3.2.  Analysis

   A critical issue is the tradeoff involved in sending traffic.  As
   argued in https://doi.org/10.23919/WONS54113.2022.9764413, reducing
   the amount of time the endpoints and the network are active can
   sometimes help save energy, e.g. in case the receiver is connected
   over a WiFi link.  Similar logic applies for any technology that has
   a certain degree of energy proportionality, e.g. cellular
   communication.  As a result, in general, delivering information as
   rapidly as possible would appear to be desirable.

   On the other hand, bandwidth-intensive applications can influence
   other applications or users by presenting a significant load on the
   network, and consequently reducing capacity available for others, or
   increasing buffering (and with it, latency) across the network path.
   For an application with intermittent data transfers, such as
   streaming video, this would seem to speak in favor of sustained but
   lower-rate delivery instead of transmitting short high-rate bursts
   (Sammy paper: https://doi.org/10.1145/3603269.3604839).  However,
   this is in contradiction with the energy-saving approach above.
   Thus, the tradeoff is: should data be sent in a way that is
   “friendly” to others (avoiding bad interference), or should it save
   energy by sending fast, increasing the chance for equipment to enter
   a “sleep” state?

   At the time of writing, the common choice for video is to opt for
   high rate delivery, potentially saving energy, and possibly at the
   expense of other traffic.  For non-urgent data transfers, the IETF-
   recommended default approach is the opposite: the LEDBAT congestion
   control mechanism (RFC 6817), which is designed for such use, will
   always “step out of the way” of other traffic, giving it a low rate
   when it competes with any other traffic.  Alternatively, if the goal
   is to reduce energy, such traffic could be sent at a high rate, at a
   strategically good moment within a longer time interval; this would
   give network equipment an opportunity to enter a sleep state in the
   remaining time period within the interval.

   Perhaps the issue is that the transport behavior (as with many other
   things) needs to take into account multiple parameters.  For example,
   it is possible that a balanced transport algorithm would be able to
   send as much as possible as soon as possible, while tracking buffer
   growth from transmission delays and scaling back if there’s any
   buffer growth.  This remains to be confirmed with experiments,
   however.

   Similarly, caching and pre-fetching designs need to take into account
   not only the likehood of having acquired the right content in memory,
   but also the sustainability cost of possibly fetching too much or the
   timing of those fetching operations.

   In general, information about the impacts of loading or not loading
   the network with additional traffic, and whether a certain sending
   pattern enables power savings through sleep modes, would be
   beneficial for the communicating endpoints.  Mechanisms for making
   such information available to the endpoints would be useful.

   (TBD add something about LEDBAT per Emile's comment)

2.3.3.  Recommednation

   What is said here is, however, just a theoretical analysis.  We
   recommend simulation and experiments to confirm what strategies would
   provide the best end-user and energy performance.  Perhaps work for
   the IRTF SUSTAIN RG.

2.4.  Equipment Longevity

   The ability to extend the useful life of protocols and/or network
   equipment in order to amortize the embedded energy costs over a
   longer period, even though it may mean that the protocols/equipment
   may not be fully optimized for the present use. [suggestion from
   Michael: This includes devising tools to inform network
   administrators and their users of the potential benefits of hardware
   upgrades, so that they can better decide to avoid unnecessary
   upgrades or delay them.]

2.4.1.  Motivation

   Embedded carbon and raw materials can be a significant part of the
   overall environmental impact of systems.  If this can be improved for
   devices that are manufactured in large quantities, the improvements
   can be significant.

2.4.2.  Analysis

   When we engineer protocols and network equipment, we are inclined to
   design them in a highly optimized manner for a very specific set of
   requirements, use cases and context.  While this is necessary in
   certain cases (e.g. constrained nodes with limits on processing
   capacity or long lived battery powered devices), there are cetainly
   cases where such optimized equipment is not absolutely required.  The
   vast majority of infrastucture network nodes on the Internet utilize
   only a faction of their design capacity most of the time.

   Designing the equipment with an eye on longevity comes with a set of
   advantages:

   *  It allows the same equipment and protocols could be reused in a
      different context in the future. e.g. A core router of today can
      become an edge router in a near future and an access router in the
      further future if the protocol implementations are adaptable.

   *  It can reduce complexity in implementations as well as in network
      management that are usually indicated in highly optimized systems

   *  It can let network equipment operate for a longer period and can
      reduce the frequency of hardware upgrades, in turn reducing the
      environmental impact associated with manufacturing, transporting,
      and disposing of the old/new hardware.

   *  One key disadvantage may be that not optimizing may result in the
      need for premature upgrades for capacity and this needs to be
      taken into account.

   Hence, it is very likely that extending the life of protocols and
   equipment with higher flexibility could provide a better
   environmental benefit than tightly optimizing only for today’s uses.

2.4.3.  Recommendation

   The guidelines above should be considered for any new system design.

2.5.  Compact encoding

   This is about better encoding methods, such as using binary instead
   of text.

2.5.1.  Motivation

   Better encoding can obviously reduce the length of message sents.  It
   remains a question mark how big overall impact this is, however.

2.5.2.  Analysis

   Better encoding methods are clearly benefical for improving the
   detailed-level effectiveness of communications.

   The main questions are, however:

   *  Is the effect of this is at a magnitude comparable to the other
      things, or if it is just absolutely tiny?  Particularly
      considering that much of the traffic on the Internet is video, and
      much of that is other content than, e.g., HTTP headers.  This
      needs more research.

   *  At what layer is the compactness achieved?  Are link, IP, or
      transport layer mechanisms that can compact some of the verbose
      messaging useful, or should each and every protocol have optimal
      compacting?

   *  Tradeoffs related to compressing (particularly if AI-based
      computationally expensive methods are used).

2.5.3.  Recommendation

   More research is needed to quantify the likely sources of measurable
   impacts.

2.6.  TBD

2.7.  ...

3.  Other Considerations

   Transparency etc.

4.  Recommendations for Further Work and Research

   Transport-related optimizations that enable devices to consume less
   power by sleeping more appear potential, but require further
   research, perhaps as part of the efforts in the SUSTAIN RG.

   TBD

   ...

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security-related discussion.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
