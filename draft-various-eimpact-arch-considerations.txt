1.  Introduction

   Environmental sustainability is an important consideration in
   networking.  Both for ensuring that networking technology can enable
   societies to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner and
   that the networks themselves are environmentally sustainable.

   This document discusses protocol and network architecture aspects
   that may have an impact on the environmental sustainability of
   network technology.  For brevity, we will use the term sustainability
   to refer to environmental sustainability.  We do note that
   sustainability as a term is widely used to refer to different notions
   of sustainability, and the most well-known larger definition of
   sustainability can be seen from the United Nations Sustainable
   Development Goals (UN SDG) [UNSDG].

   Sustainability impact and emissions from networking comes from three
   primary categories: hardware manufacturing, direct energy usage and
   construction work.  The last category is out of scope of this
   document because networking has limited means to impact construction
   work itself.  The manufacturing of networking hardware, both for
   fixed and wireless networks, is a significant source of emissions,
   and recycling of ICT equipment is still limited.  Direct energy usage
   of networking and the source of the energy have been the primary
   concerns, but as the world moves towards greener energy production,
   the relative negative impact of the emissions from manufacturing
   becomes more prominent.

   When good design and architecture can improve the sustainability of
   networks, they should certainly be applied to designing new protocols
   and building networks.  Intuitively, protocol and network
   architecture choices can have an impact on sustainability.  At the
   very least the right design and architecture can make it possible to
   have a positive impact, but of course the architecture alone is not
   enough.  The possibilities offered by the architecture need to be
   realized by implementations and practical deployments.

   To give an example of an architectural aspect that potentially has a
   sustainability impact, enabling the collection of information (e.g.,
   energy consumption) and then using that information to make smarter
   decisions is one.  For instance, understanding power consumption of
   individual nodes can be valuable input to future purchasing decisions
   or development efforts to reduce the power consumption.  Yet, as data
   collection is often rather easy, we should not overdo it in such a
   way that it leads to accumulation of dark data (i.e. data that is
   collected and stored, but never used).  All data collection consumes
   processing power, network resources and storage space, and this can
   in turn increase the emissions from the network.

   Other architectural examples include making it possible to scale
   resources or resource selection processes performed in a
   sustainability-aware fashion.  The use of communication primitives
   that maximize utility in a given problem (e.g., using multicast) or
   the use of technologies that reduce the number or size of messages
   needed for a given task (e.g., binary encoding instead of textual)
   are some further examples.

   Of course, some of these aspects may have a major impact on
   sustainability, where others may only have a minor effect.  There are
   also tradeoffs, such as side-effects of architectural choices, e.g.,
   dynamic scaling of a router network potentially impacting jitter, or
   putting cellular base stations to sleep and activating them as
   capacity needs grow may introduce a delay in matching the needs of
   the data flows.

   The document is intended to help engineering efforts in the IETF,
   provide operational guidance in the operator community, as well as to
   point to potential research directions in the IRTF.

   The scope of the document is advice on Internet and protocol
   architecture, such as what architecture or capabilities new protocol
   designs or features should have, what kind of operational network
   architectures should be deployed, and how all of these can be
   designed to best address sustainability concerns.  The focus of this
   document is to provide actionable design advice to protocol
   designers, while other documents such as
   [I-D.cparsk-eimpact-sustainability-considerations] and
   [I-D.pignataro-enviro-sustainability-architecture] go into more
   details on the general principles involved.  This document therefore
   addresses one aspect in the architecture question, and does not claim
   to cover the topic exhaustively.

   This document is also not focused on general issues around
   environmental sustainability, except those that pertain to
   architecture or significant protocol features.

   It is to be noted that networks themselves are a service, a tool, for
   all the applications and services on the Internet.  Networks connect
   data, people and services.  The increase in networking and size of
   the Internet is driven by these applications and the usage.
   Therefore the emissions from networking are tied to the applications
   and the data they consume; with less applications or data, the
   Internet would have less hardware and less energy usage.  The goals
   of this document are not to instruct application and service
   developers to choose what applications are worthwhile or how much
   content is sent.  There are many forums and parties whose mission is
   to help these developers to implement more sustainable services, such
   as, the Green Software Foundation, the Green Web Foundation, Greening
   of Streaming, to name a few.

2.  Potential Architectural Aspects

   This section presents architectural and protocol design aspects that
   can have an impact on the sustainability of networking.  In each
   topic, we provide an overview, motivation why it would be important
   to consider for more sustainable networking, an analysis and
   recommendations for future networking professionals.

2.1.  Measurement

   You have to know what is going on before you can improve.  Some
   levels of measurements are necessary for improving sustainability.
   This is particularly the case when looking at the systems as a whole
   in post-analysis.  As discussed earlier, this level of measurements
   is useful input for further actions, such as deciding what parts of
   the network need further improvement.

   But measurements may also be useful for some dynamic situations where
   power-saving decisions for instance depend on knowing the relative
   power consumption of different activities, such as when a power-off
   decision involves understanding the relative savings during the
   shutdown period vs. the power cost of shutdown and startup
   procedures, or possible need to reconfigure other nodes in the
   network due to the shutdown.

2.1.1.  Motivation

   Measurements are a necessary mechanism for both post-analysis and
   potentially some of the dynamic decisions taken by systems.  Without
   measurements of any kind, it is impossible to assess if the networks
   are functioning correctly.  It is impossible to know if the system is
   efficient, to compare the system against a baseline model.  It is
   also impossible to check that changes aiming at optimizing something
   are valuable.

   For instance, while electricity providers can make information about
   power usage available, this is only at the aggregate level.  Without
   per-device data about power usage, there would be limited basis for
   deciding where power is actually consumed and consequently, what
   improvements are most useful.

   At the same time, it is not possible to measure everything.
   Furthermore, any measurement must be validated.  Relevance of
   measurements must be periodically assessed, e.g., with comparisons
   between measurements within a network and the aggregate numbers from
   the electricity provider.

   Finally, measurements made in the field must be collected and
   organized to allow later retrieval.

2.1.2.  Analysis

   While the simplest forms of sustainability-related measurements are
   about power, there's clearly room for other measurements and other
   information as well.  To begin with, power consumption by itself may
   not be what matters most for sustainability, as the source of the
   power may be more significant in terms of the actual carbon
   footprint.

   Secondly, for many classes of devices the embedded carbon aspects or
   use of raw materials may be a significant sustainability issue.  See
   also Section 2.2.

   Third, power or energy measurements alone are of meager use if the
   cause of the consumption is not measured as well.  Any power/energy
   measurement should occur alongside at least one other measurement
   permitting to obtain an energy efficiency.  Hence a sound measurement
   architecture implies that a prior existing of an energy efficiency
   framework of some kind.

   But when it comes to energy consumption, as noted the aggregate
   information is often typically available, and it's not particularly
   hard to measure the energy consumption of individual network devices
   either.  Still, there are a number of desirable use cases where the
   measurement situation needs to improve.

2.1.2.1.  Measuring Power Efficiency

   When assessing the power consumption (Scope 2) of an IT-organization,
   emission accountants are generally looking for a metric of the
   delivered value per unit of energy.

   A commonly used method is to equate the delivered value with the
   number of bits sent or received, or to the communication capacity
   made available when there's a need for it.  The latter is important,
   as often communication networks have requirements to be able to send
   messages when there's a need for it, e.g., for emergency
   communications, not that those messages are always being sent.

2.1.3.  Recommendation

   Ongoing work at the IETF's GREEN working group is already improving
   existing energy consumption metrics and frameworks.  Some further
   considerations apply, however.  In order to meet the needs of the use
   cases discussed above, the following architectural design principles
   are proposed.

2.1.3.1.  Generality

   We recommend that any measurement framework or sustainability-related
   information sharing mechanism be designed to share different types of
   information and not limited to a single metric such as power
   consumption.  Similarly, the granularity of data collection needs to
   be configurable so that the metrics collected can be as fine-grained
   or as aggregated as needed in order to identify potential areas of
   improvement.

2.1.3.2.  Collect Metrics from Existing Equipment

   Since the need to deliver on the use cases described is urgent, the
   industry has to accept working with the capabilities of existing
   equipment in the field for collecting metrics.

   It is recommended to have a plug-in architecture with modules that
   can work with (read from and control) devices of any kind, including
   traditional networking hardware devices, cooling systems, software
   stacks, and occasionally static datasheets.

2.1.3.3.  Content Declaration for all Collected Metrics

   A warehouse filled with data collected from diverse sources is
   useless without proper labeling.  Create metadata that describes the
   collected data.  What are the source(s)?  What measurement units?
   Precision?  What is included/excluded in these numbers?

   The metadata itself must also have a formal description.  Use YANG
   for the metadata schema.  Keep the metadata attached to the dataflow
   it describes, so that the relation is clear to each component that
   has anything to do with it, including components added by other
   organizations at a later point in time.

2.1.3.4.  Collection, Aggregation, Processing, Display, Decisions

   The collected data passes through a pipeline from collection to
   decisions.  By processing we mean steps to reshape the data to match
   further aggregation and processing steps, such as unit conversions,
   sample frequency alignment, filtering, etc.

   Separate these architectural roles into separate modules in order to
   enable reuse, modular development and a transparent, configurable
   pipeline.

2.1.3.5.  Configurable Pipeline for Reuse and Transparency

   Let the pipeline connections between the components be driven by
   configuration rather than hard coded.  This enables reconfiguration
   of the processing pipeline over time, and perhaps more importantly,
   transparency into what stages the data pass through, even without
   access to or understanding of the source code of the entire system.

2.1.3.6.  Design Together with the Users

   Every system should be designed involving some of its target users.
   In order for delivered metrics to be of any value, the target
   audience needs to be aware of their existence, be able to interpret
   them and understand how they can be used in their professional
   context.

   There are many target user groups for the information produced.  Some
   examples are scientists, operations teams and IT-development
   organizations.  One critical group that is often overlooked is the
   sustainability assessment experts.  If they are not aware, don't
   understand or don't care about the produced sustainability metrics,
   the value of this work would be greatly diminished.

2.2.  Modeling

   The paucity of up-to-date information on equipment and system
   parameters, especially power consumption and maximum throughput,
   makes estimating the power consumption and energy efficiency of these
   systems extremely challenging.  In addition the rapid evolution of
   technology and products in ICT makes the estimation quickly outdated
   and possibly inaccurate.  In almost all cases physical measurement
   has to be replaced by partial measurement and mathematical modeling.

2.2.1.  Motivation

   Where power optimization choices are made, accurate information is
   required to decide the right choice.  Modeling instead of
   measurements may have to be used in some cases.

2.2.2.  Analysis

   To date, two approaches to network power modeling are accepted as
   providing a realistic estimate of network power consumption.  These
   approaches are referred to as "bottom-up" and "top-down".  The paper
   [Unifying] surveys both approaches and provide a new approach which
   unifies both of them.  The unified approach is used to estimate the
   power consumption of access, aggregation and core networks.

   The paper [Modeling] provides a model for IP Routers and the routers
   of other future Internet architectures (FIA) such as SCION and
   NEBULA.  They use a generic model which captures the commonalities of
   IP router as well as the peculiarities of FIA routers.  They conduct
   a large-scale simulation based on this router model to estimate the
   power consumption for different network architectures.

   Since routers and other network devices and functions can be
   virtualized, this article (1) provides comprehensive "graphical,
   analytical survey of the literature, over the period 2010–2020, on
   the measurement of power consumption and relevant power models of
   virtual entities as they apply to the telco cloud."  This paper A
   Methodology and Testbed to Develop an Energy Model for 5G Virtualized
   RANs IEEE Conference Publication IEEE Xplore got best paper award for
   GreenNet 2024, but I am not sure if we are interested to model 5G
   vRAN.

   There is a plethora of publications on modeling communication
   networks and DC computing.

2.2.2.1.  Customer Attribution

   When organizations assess their Scope 3 emissions, they need to sum
   up their share of emissions from all their suppliers, one of which
   for example, might be a cloud hosting service.  In order for the
   supplier to provide an emission share value back to the customer, the
   provider needs to develop an attribution formula.

   A significant challenge in accurately assessing Scope 3 emissions is
   avoiding Double Counting, where the same emission is reported by
   multiple entities.  According to the GHG Protocol best practices, it
   is crucial to establish clear guidelines and agreements between
   suppliers and customers to ensure that emissions are attributed
   correctly and not counted multiple times.  This requires transparent
   communication and precise emission reporting standards to ensure that
   all parties involved have a consistent understanding of which
   emissions belong to which organization.

   By addressing the Double Counting issue, companies can achieve more
   accurate and reliable Scope 3 emissions assessments, thereby
   contributing to better overall sustainability reporting and
   improvement efforts.

2.2.2.2.  Baselining and Benchmarking

   Establishing a baseline is a fundamental step in the process of
   improving energy efficiency and sustainability of network technology.
   Baselining involves establishing a reference point of typical energy
   usage, which is crucial for identifying inefficiencies and measuring
   improvements over time.  At this step, the controller uses only the
   collected data from datasheets and other reliable sources.

   By establishing a baseline and using benchmarking, organizations can
   determine if their networking equipment is performing normally or if
   it is deviating from expected performance, guiding necessary
   improvements.  Benchmarking involves collecting performance
   measurements of networking equipment under controlled laboratory
   conditions.  This process helps establish standardized performance
   metrics, allowing for comparison against baselines collected during
   regular operational conditions.

   The initial measurement of networking equipment's energy efficiency
   and performance, known as Baselining, should be coordinated with
   vendor specifications and industry standards to understand what is
   considered normal or optimal performance.  For example, if the
   baseline indicates that your switches operate at 5 Gbps per watt,
   while vendor specifications suggest 8 Gbps per watt and the industry
   standard is 10 Gbps per watt, actions should be taken to implement
   energy-saving measures and upgrades.  Continuously tracking
   subsequent measurements can reveal if efficiency improves towards the
   benchmark of 8-10 Gbps per watt.

   This practice ensures that any improvements can be quantifiably
   tracked over time, providing a clear measure of the effectiveness of
   the implemented changes and guiding further enhancements in network
   sustainability.

   See also [Baseline] and [BenchmarkingFramework].

2.2.3.  Recommendation

   It is still to be determined to what extent we need to work on
   modeling networks and devices in the architecture.  Is this outside
   the scope of architecture?

2.3.  Dynamic Scaling

   Dynamic scaling is about the ability to adjust resources to need and
   possibly turn some of them off during periods of low usage.  Examples
   include the set of servers needed for a service, how many duplicate
   links are needed to carry high-volume traffic, whether one needs all
   base stations with overlapping coverage areas to be on, etc.

   Networks and communications are also critical functions of the modern
   digital society.  The reliability of individual networking links or
   devices cannot be guaranteed.  As a result, various levels and forms
   of resiliency are often needed, for instance through redundancy.
   Yet, there is a question on how much redundancy is needed and how
   quickly a backup or resource increase due to capacity shortage can be
   activated.

2.3.1.  Motivation

   Outside implementation improvements, dynamic scaling is perhaps the
   method with most promise for reducing power consumption related
   environmental impacts.  Scaling can happen on a device-level
   (increasing performance as traffic levels grow) or a network segment
   level (increasing the number of active links or cellular base
   stations).

   Considering current fixed networking hardware, dynamic scaling might
   not have an impact in situations where there's only a single router
   or server serving a particular route, area, or function.  Current
   routers and switches exhibit limited potential dynamic scaling
   because the focus is on high performance and a stable connectivity.
   Yet, technology does evolve, and e.g. Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE)
   is a good example of a networking-level specification to lower energy
   consumption in idle mode.  EEE has limited impact on a network that
   has continuous traffic.

   Resiliency can be implemented within a single routers, e.g. as a
   backup power supply, between routers and switches as multiple links
   between the same nodes, having different links between two end
   points, overlapping cellular coverage, etc.  All these necessarily
   add more hardware to provide the same exact service.  Some of that
   hardware can be fully operational at all times and used to serve the
   traffic, while other links may be in hot or cold standby depending on
   the use case.

   In cellular networks, wireless coverage is typically built with
   significant overlapping coverage.  Demand and business reasons
   dictate the design of the coverage, and regulations might dictate how
   reliable the cellular service should be.  There is extensive work
   world-wide to optimize the operation of this overlapping coverage,
   e.g. by sleeping some sites at night time when traffic volumes are
   low.  A cellular basestation site can consume anything from a few kWh
   to ten or more kWh per provider.  Modern cellular base stations do
   implement numerous features to scale the energy consumption.  In
   general, a cellular base stations have a base energy consumption and
   traffic-dependent consumption, a somewhat similar behavior we can see
   in modern CPUs.

   On the network level, most large systems have significant amount of
   redundancy and spare capacity.  Where such capacity can be turned on
   or off to match the actual need at a given time, significant power
   consumption reductions can be achieved.

2.3.2.  Analysis

   Dynamic scaling could be seen as either an alternative or
   complementary to load stabilization, e.g., via "peak shaving".
   Perhaps the most realistic angle is that both are likely needed.

   The most rudimentary approach to dynamic scaling is just turning some
   resources off.  However, often this is not sufficient, and a more
   graceful/engineered approach potentially yields better results.

   A network architects need to understand the impacts of scaling
   changes on users and traffic.  These may include fate of ongoing
   sessions, latency/jitter, packets in flight, or running processes,
   attempts to contact resources that are no longer present, and the
   time it takes for the network to converge to its new state.

   Dynamic scaling requires an understanding of load levels for the
   network, so information collection is required.  It also requires
   understanding the power, time and other costs of making changes.
   (See [I-D.pignataro-enviro-sustainability-architecture] for
   discussion of tradeoffs and multi-objective optimization.)
   Understanding the resiliency requirements for a network or a piece of
   equipment is also important for the optimal control of resiliency,
   e.g., as an input to decisions on how many instances of replicated
   services need to be run and where.

   Some of the strategies that are useful in implementing a well working
   dynamic scaling include:

   *  Matching the currently used resources to the actual need, be it
      about traffic demand or resiliency.  One way to do this is to use
      of power-proportional underlying technologies, such as chipsets or
      transmission technologies.  And where this is not sufficient, the
      ability to turn components or systems on and off is an alternative
      strategy.

   *  Using load adaptive techniques allows the capacity of the nodes to
      be dynamically adjusted according to the demand.  Examples include
      Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), which dynamically adapts the link rate
      to suit traffic demand or power off links in Link Aggregation
      based on traffic demand which is empirically estimated based on
      traffic arrival.  LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) defined
      in IEEE 802.1AX [LinkAggregation] can be modified to power off
      links in an aggregation if they are not needed.

   *  Ability to enter "no new work" mode for equipment, to enable some
      resources to be eventually released/turned off.

   *  Ability to move ongoing tasks off to other equipment, to prevent
      disruption of already started tasks.

   *  Ability to schedule changes rather than making them abruptly, with
      associated signaling exchanges and possible transient routing and
      other failures.  See for instance the time-variant routing work in
      the IETF [RFC9657] [I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements]
      [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang] [I-D.ietf-tvr-alto-exposure].

   *  Efficient propagation of changes of new routes, new set of
      servers, etc. as to reduce the amount of time where state across
      the network is not synchronized.  The needs for the propagation
      solution needs to be driven by dynamic scaling and sustainability
      as well as other aspects, such as recovery from failures.

   *  Never expect a fixed set of resources, plan for dynamic set of
      resources, and build mechanisms to deal with dynamic changes.

   *  Dynamic scaling requires automation in most cases, e.g., to turn
      on new service instances.  See again
      [I-D.pignataro-enviro-sustainability-architecture] for a
      discussion of automation.

   *  Interaction with the energy grid can enable dynamic load shifting.
      For instance, a demand-response technique can be used where the
      system temporarily reduces its energy usage in response to pricing
      signals from a smart grid.  The proposed demand-response technique
      involves deferring the load from elastic requests to later time
      periods in order to reduce the server demand and the current
      energy usage, and hence, energy costs [LoadShifting].

   *  Energy-aware routing.  This generally aims at aggregating traffic
      flows over a subset of the network devices and links, allowing
      other links and interconnection devices to be switched off.  These
      solutions shall preserve connectivity and QoS, for instance by
      limiting the maximum utilization over any link, or ensuring a
      minimum level of path diversity.  There are also algorithms for
      Green Traffic engineering.  For instance [Segment] employs segment
      routing.  Experimental analysis results [Experiment] show that the
      resource usage for SRv6 could be more than 70% lower than that of
      the SPF-based forwarding, depending on the network topology.

2.3.3.  Recommendation

   The guidelines above need to be considered specifically for each
   protocol and system design.  Further work in detailing this guidance
   would also be useful.

   It is likely that there is increased attention to resiliency in the
   future, given for instance the increased importance of the tasks
   supported by networks or the potentially increasing frequency of
   natural disasters as a result of global warming.

2.4.  Transport

   Transport protocols are the flexible tools that make it possible for
   communication flows between parties to adjust themselves to the
   dynamic conditions that exist in the network at any given time:
   available bandwidth, delays, congestion, the ability of a peer to
   send or receive traffic, and so on.  Depending on the conditions, an
   individual flow may carry traffic at widely different rates, may
   pause for some time, etc.  Various higher-level transport solutions
   may also cache or pre-fetch information.

   This behavior will have an effect on sustainability as well, e.g., in
   what periods the endpoint and network systems are active or when they
   could be in reduced activity or sleep states.

   Cellular networks and mobile links can scale their energy usage based
   on load and enter a low-power state when a traffic flow ends.  Thus,
   in theory, the faster the data is transferred, the faster the device
   radio chipset can enter a low-power state.

2.4.1.  Motivation

   Transport behavior would have a possibility of impacting how much
   downtime or sleep can be had in the communication system, either on
   the end systems or routers or other equipment in between.  The
   savings can be significant, at least in wireless systems.

   Improvements through transport behavior are only useful if the
   involved systems have power proportionality.

2.4.2.  Analysis

   A critical issue is the tradeoff involved in sending traffic.  As
   argued in [NotTradeOff], reducing the amount of time the endpoints
   and the network are active can sometimes help save energy, e.g. in
   case the receiver is connected over a WiFi link.  Similar logic
   applies for any technology that has a certain degree of energy
   proportionality, e.g. cellular communication.  As a result, in
   general, delivering information as rapidly as possible would appear
   to be desirable.

   On the other hand, bandwidth-intensive applications can influence
   other applications or users by presenting a significant load on the
   network, and consequently reducing capacity available for others, or
   increasing buffering (and with it, latency) across the network path.
   For an application with intermittent data transfers, such as
   streaming video, this would seem to speak in favor of sustained but
   lower-rate delivery instead of transmitting short high-rate bursts
   [Sammy].  However, this is in contradiction with the energy-saving
   approach above.  Thus, the tradeoff is: should data be sent in a way
   that is "friendly" to others (avoiding bad interference), or should
   it save energy by sending fast, increasing the chance for equipment
   to enter a "sleep" state?

   At the time of writing, the common choice for video is to opt for
   higher rate delivery, potentially saving energy, and possibly at the
   expense of other traffic.  For non-urgent data transfers, the IETF-
   recommended default approach is the opposite: the LEDBAT congestion
   control mechanism [RFC6817], which is designed for such use, will
   always "step out of the way" of other traffic, giving it a low rate
   when it competes with any other traffic.  Alternatively, if the goal
   is to reduce energy, such traffic could be sent at a high rate, at a
   strategically good moment within a longer time interval; this would
   give network equipment an opportunity to enter a sleep state in the
   remaining time period within the interval.

   Perhaps the issue is that the transport behavior (as with many other
   things) needs to take into account multiple parameters.  For example,
   it is possible that a balanced transport algorithm would be able to
   send as much as possible as soon as possible, while tracking buffer
   growth from transmission delays and scaling back if there's any
   buffer growth.  This remains to be confirmed with experiments,
   however.

   Similarly, caching and pre-fetching designs need to take into account
   not only the likelihood of having acquired the right content in
   memory, but also the sustainability cost of possibly fetching too
   much or the timing of those fetching operations.

   In general, information about the impacts of loading or not loading
   the network with additional traffic, and whether a certain sending
   pattern enables power savings through sleep modes, would be
   beneficial for the communicating endpoints.  Mechanisms for making
   such information available to the endpoints would be useful.

2.4.3.  Recommendation

   What is said here is, however, just a theoretical analysis.  We
   recommend simulation and experiments to confirm what strategies would
   provide the best end-user and energy performance.  This may be work
   that fits within the IRTF SUSTAIN research group.

2.5.  Equipment Longevity

   This section discusses the ability to extend the useful life of
   protocols and/or network equipment in order to amortize the embedded
   energy costs over a longer period, even though it may mean that the
   protocols/equipment may not be fully optimized for the present use.
   This includes devising tools to inform network administrators and
   their users of the potential benefits of network equipment upgrades,
   so that they can make better choices on what upgrades are necessary
   and when.

   It should be noted that from an environmental sustainability
   perspective, it is not necessarily always the best choice to upgrade
   network equipment whenever slightly less power-hungry and "greener"
   alternatives become available.  The environmental cost of amortizing
   the carbon embedded inside equipment over its lifetime, for example,
   the carbon associated with the manufacturing of the equipment that is
   to be replaced, should be taken into consideration as well.

2.5.1.  Motivation

   Embedded carbon and raw materials can be a significant part of the
   overall environmental impact of systems.  If this can be improved for
   devices that are manufactured in large quantities, the improvements
   can be significant.

   The more the world moves toward low-carbon energy sources, the more
   the manufacturing matters in the holistic view.  Today there can be
   an order of magnitude difference in average emissions for a kWh of
   electricity between two countries.  Thus, any estimates that seek to
   compare the manufacturing and use phase emissions of a network
   equipment would have to be calculated per country or region, and
   there is no universal result for the whole planet.

   Long equipment lifetimes are only useful if the longer lifetimes can
   be achieved without compromising other aspects of sustainability,
   such as when using a high-end and power-hungry router in place of
   small routers.  The exact moment when a hardware change is warranted
   for sustainability differs between countries and regions.

2.5.2.  Analysis

   When we engineer protocols and network equipment, we are inclined to
   design them in a highly optimized manner for a very specific set of
   requirements, use cases and context.  While this is necessary in
   certain cases (e.g. constrained nodes with limits on processing
   capacity or long lived battery powered devices), there are certainly
   cases where such optimized equipment is not absolutely required.
   Most infrastucture network nodes on the Internet utilize only a
   fraction of their design capacity most of the time.

   Designing the equipment with an eye on longevity comes with a set of
   advantages:

   *  It allows the same equipment and protocols be reused in a
      different context in the future. e.g. A core router of today can
      become an edge router in a near future and an access router in the
      further future if the protocol implementations are adaptable.

   *  It can reduce complexity in implementations as well as in network
      management that are usually indicated in highly optimized systems

   *  It can let network equipment operate for a longer period and can
      reduce the frequency of hardware upgrades, in turn reducing the
      environmental impact associated with manufacturing, transporting,
      and disposing of the old/new hardware.

   *  One key disadvantage may be that not optimizing may result in the
      need for premature upgrades for capacity and this needs to be
      considered.

   Hence, it is very likely that extending the life of protocols and
   equipment with higher flexibility could provide a better
   environmental benefit than tightly optimizing only for today’s uses.

   Another aspect that can play an important role in extending the
   longevity of equipment concerns software-defined networking, in the
   sense of designing networking equipment in such a way that new
   equipment capabilities and features can be introduced via software
   upgrades as opposed to requiring hardware replacement.  This requires
   system architectures that incorporate the necessary infrastructure to
   support such upgrades in a secure manner that does not compromise
   equipment integrity.

2.5.3.  Recommendation

   The guidelines above should be considered for any new system design.
   If some aspect of protocol or network equipment design choice could
   be made more generic and flexible without a significant performance
   and sustainability impact, it needs to be studied in further detail.
   Specifically, the potential additional sustainability costs due to
   forgoing optimization need to be weighed against the potential
   savings in embedded carbon and raw material costs brought about by
   premature upgrades.  There are also cases where equipment upgrades
   are done to provide better peak performance characteristics (e.g.
   higher advertised speeds towards consumers) and these need to be
   viewed as well with the same tradeoffs in mind.  Finally, when
   designing networks it is recommended to consider whether it is
   possible to reuse retiring equipment in a different location or for a
   different function (e.g. move it to lower traffic geographies, core
   routers become edge/access routers etc.)

2.6.  Compact encoding

   This is about better encoding methods, such as using binary instead
   of text.

2.6.1.  Motivation

   Better encoding can obviously reduce the length of messages sent.  It
   remains a question mark how big overall impact this is, however.  It
   should only be performed if it gives a measurable overall impact.

2.6.2.  Analysis

   Better encoding methods are clearly beneficial for improving the
   detailed-level effectiveness of communications.

   The main questions are, however:

   *  Is the effect of this is at a magnitude comparable to the other
      things, or if it is just absolutely tiny?  Particularly
      considering that much of the traffic on the Internet is video, and
      much of that is other content than, e.g., HTTP headers.  Moran et
      al. argued in their 2022 paper [CBORGreener] [RFC9547] that that
      for a weather data example from [RFC8428] [RFC9193] there are
      significant savings.  However, this needs more research in terms
      of the overall impact across different examples and the general
      make up of Internet traffic.

   *  At what layer is the compactness achieved?  Are link, IP, or
      transport layer mechanisms that can compact some of the verbose
      messaging useful, or should each protocol have optimal compacting?

   *  Tradeoffs related to compressing (particularly if AI-based
      computationally expensive methods are used).

2.6.3.  Recommendation

   More research is needed to quantify the likely sources of measurable
   impacts.

   Of course, new protocols can generally be designed to work with
   compact encoding, unless there is a significant reason not to.  But
   efforts to modify existing protocols for the sake of encoding
   efficiency should be warranted by the above mentioned quantification
   results.

2.7.  Sustainable by Design: Data Governance Perspective

   Incorporating sustainability into the design phase of network
   architecture is critical for ensuring long-term environmental and
   operational benefits.  From a Data Governance point of view,
   "Sustainable by Design" involves embedding sustainability principles
   and practices into the data management frameworks and processes from
   the outset.

2.7.1.  Motivation

   Data governance plays a pivotal role in shaping how data is
   collected, stored, processed, and used.  By integrating
   sustainability into these processes, organizations can ensure that
   their data practices contribute to environmental goals, such as
   reducing carbon footprints, optimizing resource usage, and minimizing
   waste.

2.7.2.  Analysis

   Key elements of Sustainable by Design in data governance include:

   *  Data Minimization: Collecting only the data that is necessary and
      useful, reducing storage and processing requirements, which in
      turn lowers energy consumption.

   *  Efficient Data Storage Solutions: Implementing energy-efficient
      data storage technologies and practices that prioritize reduced
      power usage and cooling needs.

   *  Lifecycle Management: Ensuring that data is managed throughout its
      lifecycle in a way that minimizes environmental impact, including
      secure and sustainable data disposal practices.

   *  Transparency and Accountability: Establishing clear data
      governance policies that promote transparency in data usage and
      accountability for sustainability objectives.

2.7.3.  Recommendation

   Organizations should adopt data governance frameworks that
   incorporate sustainability as a core principle.  This includes
   setting clear sustainability goals, measuring progress towards these
   goals, and continuously improving data management practices to
   enhance sustainability.  By doing so, organizations can ensure that
   their data operations are not only effective but also environmentally
   responsible.

3.  Recommendations for Further Work and Research

   Dynamic scaling, i.e., the ability to respond to demand variations
   and resiliency requirements while optimizing energy consumption
   clearly has significant potential for savings.  Past and ongoing work
   in various systems and protocols has looked at this, of course, but
   we believe work also remains.  Any large scale system likely benefits
   from further analysis, unless already ongoing.  Guidance in
   {dynscale} simple, and further work in detailing this guidance would
   also be useful.

   Transport-related optimizations (see {transport}) that enable devices
   to consume less power by sleeping more appear to have potential for
   significant savings, but confirming this requires further research.
   Such research could be performed in the context of the recently
   chartered SUSTAIN research group.

   More research is needed to quantify the likely sources of measurable
   impacts when it comes to efficient protocol message encoding
   discussed in {encoding}. Again, this is work that the research group
   could take on.

   TBD

   ...

4.  Security Considerations

   It is possible that the introduction of features and architectural
   properties to facilitate environmentally sustainable Internet
   technology introduces new attack vectors or other security
   ramifications.

   For example, the introduction of measurements and metrics for the
   purpose of saving energy could be misused for the opposite effect
   when compromised.  For example, measurements might be tampered with
   in order to cause an operator to waste energy.  Energy measurements,
   when abused, might also result in compromised security, for example
   by allowing to infer usage profiles.  They could also be abused to
   implement a covert communications channel in which information is
   leaked via tampered measurement values that are being reported.

   Networking features and technology choices may have security
   implications regardless of why they are introduced, including for
   reasons of environmental sustainability.  The possibility of this
   needs to be taken into consideration, understood, and communicated to
   allow for their mitigation.
