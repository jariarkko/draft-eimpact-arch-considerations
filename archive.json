This in turn surfaces a bug within the author metadata variables, with a fix adding a role of editor (and removing the (air quotes) 'family name' of \"Ed.\" :writing_hand:. Lastly, it incorporates acknowledgments for all contributors to the existing draft since November 2023. Oh, and adds Mac's .DS_Store to the .gitignore list :smile:",
