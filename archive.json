This in turn surfaces a bug within the author metadata variables, with a fix adding a role of editor (and removing the (air quotes) 'family name' of \"Ed.\" :writing_hand:. Lastly, it incorporates acknowledgments for all contributors to the existing draft since November 2023. Oh, and adds Mac's .DS_Store to the .gitignore list :smile:",

Extensive work.\r\n\r\nMany things in this PR.\r\n\r\nAdding new references: Great, thanks!\r\n\r\nGeneral updates on intro & measurement section: Great, thanks!\r\n\r\nOne exception is that the changes include removing a mention of the GREEN WG. Perhaps we should keep that still explicitly.\r\n\r\nThe questions on whether some subsections in measurement should be kept:\r\n- agree on \"design with users\"\r\n- but I'd suggest the two pipeline subsections could be merged under one that simply says:\r\n  \"Measurements typically pass through a pipeline from collection to processing (aggregation, unit conversions, etc.) and decisions. Such pipelines should be configurable and modular, as the needs for different type of combining or processing information evolve.\"\r\n\r\nThe edits regarding the addition of recommendations from draft-pignataro require more work, could they be separated from this PR? Specifically, I'm working on that, but I think (1) the encoding/decoding aspects belong to a different section that we already have, compact encoding. That section should address both the compactness of the encoding and the effort required to do it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the part about rapid discovery and convergence seems close to what we already have in the dynamic scaling section. A review of what needs to change is needed.\r\n\r\nThird, chattiness probably belongs to the transport topic.\r\n\r\nFourth, the exploiting burstiness text piece probably points to a need to generalize the current text in the transport section. But I don't think we should add this text as such. It makes a recommendation for smooth traffic without really exploring the different tradeoffs at all. Not saying the current text in the transport section is perfect in this sense either, in particular it should probably be more open ended what the right behavior is. But there's very much a need talk about the detailed tradeoffs, such as impact on sleep vs. avoiding peak capacity, avoiding disturbance to others vs. taking longer to be awake, micro sleep vs. long sleep periods, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, the I-D.irtf-nmrg-green-ps reference in the recommendations for further work. We definitely should reference it. Could we pick up the more architecture oriented conclusions from it?\r\n\r\n",

Concerned that the document should have an impact on the protocol designers. If we are too broad and general that's not great. But if we keep the general and protocol-designer advice clearly separated then we can perhaps avoid problems.\r\n\r\nSuresh: goes in right direction, the question is how actionable result we get. Consider putting text somewhere even if it just about future work needed.\r\n\r\nJari: I like the future work category of \"advice\". Or the separation of protocol designer advice and further work needed.\r\n",
